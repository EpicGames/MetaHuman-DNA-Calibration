All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## [1.3.1] - 2024-12-20

### Added
- example script to assemble face rig in Maya with textures `dna_viewer_build_rig_with_textures.py`
- added support for Maya 2024 in dna_calibration.mod file

## [1.3.0] - 2024-08-15

### Added
- support for Maya 2024
- support for Python 3.10
- added source code comments to python wrappers

### Fixed
- `CalculateMeshLowerLODsCommand` was rewritten to address edge cases discovered with eye lashes and to handle some common cases of invalid UV data. 
- `RotateCommand` to rotate blend shape target deltas as well.
- `SetBlendShapeTargetDeltasCommand` to allow setting vertex indices as well.
- Swig generated classes are now wrapped instead of being monkey-patched to invoke constructors and destructors (which allows building with newer Swig versions - 4.0.x and 4.1.x).

### Changed
- CMake files to add test cases that execute the example scripts and allow generating bundled archives with CPack. 
- Binaries for embeddedRL4 plugin to be .so files.


## [1.2.0] - 2023-06-30
